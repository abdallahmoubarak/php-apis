# php-apis
Hi @channel, assignment #2 due tomorrow at 10:00 AM: API1: Implement a GET API that takes a string and returns a json object stating if that string is a palindrome or not. API2: Implement a POST API that takes 3 inputs (a, b and c) and the API should return the result of this expression: a^3 + b*c - a/b. API3: Implement a POST API that takes a password a returns if the password is strong or not. API4: Implement a GET API that displays how many days are left for Christmas. Bonus: Implement a front end and link these APIs. Deliverable: Repo Link on Google Sheet.
